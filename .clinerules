# Form Force 2.0 - Claude Configuration

## Project Context
This is a Flutter/Dart full-stack platform transforming forms into intelligent processes with AI-enhanced data capture.

## Architecture
- Multi-platform Flutter app (Web, iOS, Android)
- Monorepo structure with apps and shared packages
- Dart backend with REST API and WebSocket support
- PostgreSQL database with Supabase
- AI integration via OpenAI

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use null-safety and strong typing throughout
- Follow official Flutter/Dart style guide
- Use dependency injection via get_it
- State management with Riverpod
- Implement offline-first architecture
- Always write unit and widget tests for new features

## Project Structure
```
/apps/mobile - Flutter app (iOS, Android, Web)
/packages/backend - Dart REST API server
/packages/shared - Shared models and utilities
/packages/ai_service - AI validation and enhancement
/supabase - Database schemas and migrations
```

## Development Guidelines
1. Always maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
2. Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits
3. Test changes locally before committing
4. Update documentation when adding new features
5. Keep dependencies up to date
6. Follow security best practices (encryption, authentication)
7. Optimize for performance and offline usage

## Key Technologies
- Flutter 3.x
- Dart 3.x
- PostgreSQL + Supabase
- Firebase (push notifications)
- OpenAI API
- Docker (deployment)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for critical flows
- E2E tests for major user journeys

## When Making Changes
- Check existing patterns in the codebase first
- Reuse shared components from /packages/shared
- Maintain consistency with existing code style
- Consider offline scenarios
- Think about multi-platform compatibility
- Update relevant documentation files
